			<li>to promote and guarantee efficient and faithful service from us to the public and to insure to us in return for that service a fair reward and a just security;</li>
			<li>in accordance with the Agreement between the Board of Education of the City of Chicago and Chicago Teachers Union, to assert, secure, and protect the inherent and fundamental equity in our jobs;</li>

			<ins>
			<li>to unify the educators of traditional public schools and public charter schools in the City of Chicago, together with other Chicago-area educators that may <u>join</u> with this Union.</li> <li>to promote racial, economic and social justice in order to achieve educational justice and build community and labor coalitions to achieve that objective.</li></ins></ol>

The procedures of accusation, trial, and judgment shall be as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Charges may be made against a member of the Union only by the other members. These charges must be made in writing and signed by the accusers. The charges must specify the overt act or acts and the time and place of their occurrence. They must also be filed with the Recording Secretary, who shall at his/her earliest convenience, give to the President a verbatim copy of the charges, including the signatures.</li>
				<li>The President shall call a meeting of the Executive Board for the purpose of deciding whether the charges warrant a trial. A two-thirds majority vote of this meeting shall be necessary to order trial. If the Board fails to so order, the Recording Secretary shall so notify the accusers and make appropriate notation on his/her copy of the charges.</li>
				<li>If trial is ordered, the Executive Board shall at once set a time and place therefore, but the time shall not be earlier than two weeks after passing the order. The Recording Secretary shall write on the charges: “Trial ordered (date),” and shall notify both accusers and accused by personal service or a return-receipt registered letter, stating the action of the Executive Board, specifying the time and place of the trial, notifying them to appear at said time and place, together with their witnesses (if any) and enclosing a verbatim copy of the charges.</li>
				<li>When the Recording Secretary has made personal service of the notice above provided for or shall have received the return receipts from the registered letters, he/she shall notify the President of the Union and shall send notice of the trial meeting to each member of the Executive Board. If any member of the Executive Board is a signer of the charges, he/she shall not sit as a member of the Trial Board during the trial.</li>
				<li>The President shall direct the Recording Secretary to read the charges, including the signatures, and shall call upon the accusers by name to testify. The testimony of witnesses other than the accusers may also be taken. When the direct testimony is finished, the accused or any member of the Trial Board may question the accusers and the other witnesses. The <del>p</del><ins>P</ins>resident shall call upon the accused to testify. After this direct testimony, the accused may be questioned by the accusers or the members of the Trial Board. He/she may then present his/her witnesses, if any. These witnesses shall be subject to questioning as above. All witnesses, including the accusers and the accused, shall confine themselves to testimony on facts and to answering questions. Only the Trial Board, the accusers and the accused, and the witnesses shall be present, but witnesses may be excluded from the hearing room when they are not testifying.</li>
				<li>When all testimony is concluded, the President shall cause all persons except the members of the Trial Board to leave the room. The Board shall then proceed to deliberate on a verdict. <del>It shall arrive at the verdict by ballot.</del> A three-fourths majority of the Trial Board members present shall be necessary for a verdict. If<ins> a three-fourths vote for conviction cannot be achieved, the charges shall be dismissed.</ins><del>, after not less than 10 ballots, no verdict has been voted, the Trial Board as such shall adjourn sine die and the Recording Secretary shall write across the face of his/her copy of the charges the statement: “Trial held (date). No verdict. Charges dismissed.” He/she</del><ins> The Recording Secretary</ins> shall send written notice to that effect to both accusers and accused. If a verdict is voted, the Recording Secretary shall write the verdict across the face of the charges.</li>
				<li><ins>If the verdict is “Guilty,” the Trial Board shall at once fix the penalty. Such penalty may be either suspension from Union membership for a designated</ins> period<del> not to exceed one calendar year, or</del><ins>,</ins> expulsion from the Union<ins>, and/or a fine</ins>. <ins>The penalty shall be determined by separate vote, and decided by majority vote. Members found guilty of crossing or working behind a Union picket line may be fined an amount equal to their earnings during that time.</ins> In case of suspension from membership, annual dues shall run against the suspended member as provided in Article II<del>, Section 2,</del> of these By-Laws. The Recording Secretary shall notify the accusers and accused of the verdict and shall state the penalty, if any, imposed by the Trial Board. This letter shall be counter-signed by the President of the Union.</li>
				<li>If, at the time of the trial of an accused, the Recording Secretary has in hand return Post Office receipts or other proof of service of notice to appear, and if less than three-fourths of the accusers do appear as directed, the President shall declare the charges dismissed, and the Recording Secretary shall so notify the accusers, in writing.</li>
				<li>If at least three-fourths of the accusers do appear and the accused does not appear or present a reason for non-appearance acceptable to the Trial Board, this failure to appear shall be judged prima facie evidence of guilt, and the Trial Board may render a verdict in accordance therewith.</li>
				<li>Within thirty days after any final action by the Trial Board, either accusers or accused may appeal to the Appeal Committee which shall consist of the Functional Vice Presidents. The appeal shall be perfected when written notice addressed to the President is <del>served on him personally, or </del>delivered to the office of the Union and given to any officer<ins> or the President’s designee</ins>. The President shall within 10 days of the notice of the appeal, convene the Functional Vice Presidents and he/she shall be chairperson of the committee, but shall not vote as a member thereof.
